# Terrible Discord Bot

***

#### Installation
1. Download Node.js from the [official website](https://nodejs.org/en/ "Node.js offical website").
2. Make a folder that the bot will reside in. You can do this in Command Prompt why typing `mkdir InsertBotFolderNameHere`.
3. Clone this repository by downloading either the zip file or with [Git](https://git-scm.com/ "Git offical website").
    - Once you have Git installed (if your using it), you can clone this repo with `git clone https://github.com/TheChickenBros/DiscordBot.git`
    - To download the zip file, click on the green **Code** icon and hit **Download ZIP**. Then extract the contents into your directory.
4. Open Command Promt and type `cd InsertBotFolderNameHere`. I prefer Powershell but it doesnt matter.
5. Type `node index.js` to start the bot.
6. Enjoy?
